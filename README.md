# Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Project

Author : Aditya Vikram Dash

## Goal of the Project

1. A tidy data set
2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. Analysis R Script

## Files

### CodeBook.md
a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

### run_analysis.R
performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition: 
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### tidydata.txt
is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
